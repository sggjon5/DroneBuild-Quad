## 🤕 Mistakes

- Did not tell the vendor of the motors I was using when ordering the ESC, so had to buy a DATA LINK V2 to flash the firmware myself
- ESCs are a bit big to run the cables through the motor arms so had to run them externally (still looks neat but less so than internal cabling)
- Bought a wire stripper/cutter that is not very good at cutting...
