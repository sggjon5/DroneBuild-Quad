## 🚠 Cable/Wiring Diagram
Below is a schematic of the wiring within the quad. I feel compelled to say (Not to scale).

It is an .svg file and therefore you should be able to download & zoom to read the small text notes scattered around it.

## 🤕 Mistakes

- Did not tell the vendor of the motors I was using when ordering the ESC, so had to buy a DATA LINK V2 to flash the firmware myself
- ESCs are a bit big to run the cables through the motor arms so had to run them externally (still looks neat but less so than internal cabling)
- Bought a wire stripper/cutter that is not very good at cutting...
