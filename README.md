Intended to be comprehensive (but not too boring) and honest. Any questions, omissions or mistakes feel free to reach out. It has not been endorsed or sponsored by any of the products or sellers that I mention. If I have anything particular to say (good or bad) about an experience or product, it is likely included near to the section where it was utilised in the build process.

## 🚠 Cable/Wiring Diagram
Below is a schematic of the wiring within the quad. I feel compelled to say that it is in fact, (Not to scale).

It is an .svg file and therefore you should be able to download & zoom to read the small text notes scattered around it.

It does not yet include the companion computer, but I anticipate connecting this to the telem2 port of the flight controller. I have not yet decided how this will be powered.

This was made on a Canva whiteboard, as those who know me will be aware, I am a big advocate for Canva for all things presentation and design.

## 🤕 Mistakes

- Did not tell the vendor of the motors I was using when ordering the ESC, so had to buy a DATA LINK V2 to flash the firmware myself (~£150)
- ESCs are a bit big to run the cables through the motor arms so had to run them externally (still looks neat but less so than internal cabling) (no cost)
- Bought a wire stripper/cutter that is not very good at cutting and honestly surplus to requirements for a project of this scale... (~£25)
- Ordered the wrong XT60 pigtail (female) and soldered it to the drone, warranting either a replacement or a male to male XT60 converter (~£5)

## 🎉 Positive & Good Things

- The communication and fast delivery from all of the vendors (most notably 3DXR and FlyingTech) has been brilliant every time
- The soldering station is solid, does everything I would want it to and probably made my life a lot easier
- The top plate of the frame is a PDB, which I think is cool
- The battery charger did not break the bank, and it can be used as a bench DC power supply
- The build quality of the X18 transmitter feels very sturdy and good
