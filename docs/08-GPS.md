It is pretty easy to install and use and there is plenty of documentation online. Their official documentation is [here](https://docs.cubepilot.org/user-guides/here-4/here-4-manual) and I also used this video in how to configure it within mission planner (you may want to defer this until the next step when you are doing all of the software configuration). With that said, at this point, the drone build in terms of electronics is complete and you can therefore connect to mission planner via the telemetry link and update the parameters to make it function as you desire.
