# 🛠️ Introduction

For a bit of context, I completed an MEng in Aerospace Engineering in 2021 and have since pursued a PhD with a more computer science–oriented focus, primarily exploring decision-making under uncertainty for applications in multi-target tracking. As PhDs often are, it has been heavily software-based, and I’ve found myself missing the hands-on challenges that come with developing physical systems, the kind that operate in the real world, not just the virtual one.

To address the above, I decided to build a quadcopter drone capable of carrying a companion computer and onboard sensors, with the aim of testing some of the algorithms I’ve developed during my PhD in real-world conditions. This repository is intended to document the full lifecycle of building the quadcopter, culminating in a functional testbed for the aforementioned sensor management algorithms.

The drone itself has been designed to be general purpose, with enough payload capacity to support a variety of small, but meaningful, components — making it a flexible platform for future development projects as well.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Learn the full drone build process: from frame selection to first flight
- Create a modular and maintainable quadcopter that can be modified for other purposes
- Share a detailed, beginner friendly guide that is open and accessible

---

## 🔍 What You'll Find in This Guide

This repo contains:

- A full parts & tools list, with links and costs
- A step-by-step recollection of the process, including mistakes and things added costs...
- Wiring diagrams and (a very small selection of) 3D printable parts
- Software setup (ArduCopter)
- Demo videos and photos (from when I remembered to take them...)

Whether it is just curiosity, you are planning your own custom build, or stuck halfway through it, I hope this guide is helpful.

## 🧠 Things I Have Learned (or at least had to refresh!)

- Basic electronics & soldering
- CAD (Fusion360)
- 3D printing (had to replace the hot end too)
- Firmware flashing and configuration
- Mechanical assembly
- ETHOS (transmitter OS)
- Mission Planner (ArduPilot)
