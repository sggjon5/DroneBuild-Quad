# ðŸª«ESC (no ESC emoji)

The ESCs that I selected were the T-Motor Alpha 60A ESC as they were the most appropriate available from where I was ordering the bulk of the components from.

**I should note that if you are going to use the t-motor alpha series, you need to put the corresponding firmware onto them, using a DATALINK V2 (~Â£150)**.

3DXR offer to do this for you if you leave them a note of which motor you are planning on using. You also need to check the t-motor website for which ESC is compatable with which motor. The motor I have (MN4014) is not paired with this ESC. In the interim I have flashed the firmware of the motor that _is_ available that is closest in size and KV rating. 

I did however reach out to t-motor and they have promised to write some custom firmware (within 3-4 weeks) to pair this ESC with this motor, which if it happens, is excellent customer service as the error is entirely my fault.

The recommended pairings for the motors and ESCs can be found [here](https://store.tmotor.com/article.php?id=249&srsltid=AfmBOopyixdGDCuPRMzZdIhsSHbEJ-VuuUXD7wQcLlyIUUaO3qEwRVjc).

## Using T-Motor software and DATALINK V2 to flash firmware of motor
As mentioned above, you need to flash the firmware for your motor with the Alpha series of ESCs, using a DATALINK V2 and their software suite. A good video on how to compelte this process is here:

Things to watch out for:

- You need to be able to power the ESC to do this
- The ordering of when you plug things in/power things on/click buttons in their software is very important, follow the video carefully.
- The software for the Data LINK V2 can be downloaded from [here](https://uav-en.tmotor.com/2018/alpha_0502/158.html)
