# ðŸ§² Motors

The motors selected for this project were the T-motor MN4014 330KV motors - a member of the navigator series.

The numbers within a motors name typically conform to the convention of stator diameter by stator height - so in this case, these motors are 40mm in diameter and 14mm in height, forming the 4014.

The KV rating is an indicator of speed potential. It describes the revolutions per minute (RPM) a motor will achieve per Volt that is put into it. Typically, higher Kv motors spin faster and have lower torque and the opposite is true of lower Kv rated motors.
