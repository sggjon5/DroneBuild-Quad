# ðŸ“» Telemetry
The telemetry selected for this build was the RFDesigns 868x-EU radio bundle.

The setting up of these components was actually very simple. As I had purchased a pair as a bundle, they had already been programmed to have the same settings and find eachother. I did find a brilliant video that spoke all about them and was worth the watch in its entirety to understand. I will link it below.

This video talks you through everything I would type here and is much easier to scrub through and find the parts you need/want. Most notably, the checking that all the parameters are aligned on both your radios and how to actually plug them in and check it is all working.

To state the obvious, one of the telemety goes onto the drone and one goes into your computer (via the USB cable).

I attached the one on the drone to the underside of the main body, using a piece of 3M foam tape and threaded the cables through the holes in the lower and top plate to plug it into my telem1 port on the cube pilot.
