# üèóÔ∏è Frame Assembly

The frame selected was the Tarot 650 sport. The primary reasons were the size and weight and the fact that the top plate is actually a power distribution board (which I think is pretty cool). The retractable landing gear is a nice feature that is included but this was not really a major factor in the decision. Maybe I will come to love this if I install a camera onto it...

The frame comes neatly packaged in a Tarot box and is quite easy to put together. The screws are pretty small so my advice (as with pretty much all of this process) would be to set up the area you are working in so that it is difficult to drop and lose them. With that said, there were spares in the box should you lose any.

I found this helpful video online, which I used in conjunction with the instructions that came in the box. Flicking back and forth between the two seemed to serve me well and it did not take too long to assemble the core components.

I think given the veracity of the instructions I have pointed you to (and my lack of taking photos throughout) there is not much need in me writing a comprehensive instruction set for this part of the process.

My only notes would be:

- Be extra careful of overtightening the motor mounts and stripping the holes
- Do not tighten any screws that you will be loosening very shortly to install other components
