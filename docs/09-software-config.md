# ðŸ’» Software Configuration

For this build I am using Ardupilot and mission planner. The setup process is well guided and there is plenty of good documentation online for this. 

The things I would highlight though are:

- You do not need to calibrate the Alpha ESC's from what I can find online
- You need to fix your Flight controller and GPS in place to do the calibrations
- **Do not put the propellors on for any of the testing**
- Check, check and check again that your motors are spinning in the right direction that is expected by the software
