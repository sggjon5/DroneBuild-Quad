# 🔨 Tools List
A table of everything I purchased for this build. You could get away with buying cheaper versions of many of these items but I have often put some time into researching which items are well reviewed/recommended by reputable sources before purchasing any larger items.


| Category        | Component                       | Supplier / Link                                                                 | Price (£) | Notes |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------|
| **LiPo Safety Bag**       | GensAce LiPO Safe Bag          | [3DXR](https://www.3dxr.co.uk/electronics-c78/chargers-c74/gensace-gens-ace-lipo-safe-bag-p5557)                           | £9.99    | Cheaper ones were not in stock, this one is the same shape as the battery though which is nice.  |
| **LiPo Charger / DC Power Supply**       | SkyRC S100 neo AC 100W / DC 200W 1-6S Battery Charger          | [FlyingTech](https://www.flyingtech.co.uk/product/skyrc-s100-neo-battery-charger/)                           | £44.99    | So far this is great, wanted one that can be used as a DC supply so that I can use as a bench power for testing when building. Not sure how common this is with chargers but this one was well reviewed and not that expensive. It does not feel like a gigantic fire hazard! Also small enough that you could take it into the field when flying to assess battery status! A great allrounder. |
| **LiPo Charger to Croc Clips Lead**       | XT60 Female to Croc Clips Cable          | [FlyingTech](https://www.flyingtech.co.uk/product/charge-lead-adapter-xt60-female-to-crocodile-clips/)                           | £4.80    | So I could use the charger as a bench power supply.  |
| **Multimeter**       | Digital Multimeter          | [FlyingTech](https://www.flyingtech.co.uk/product/chy-a830l-digital-multimeter-w-backlit-display/)                           | £12.00    | Cheap and feels it, but serves its purpose for continutity checking.  |
| **Wire Strippers**       | Self Adjusting wire strippers and cutter          | [FlyingTech](https://www.flyingtech.co.uk/product/self-adjusting-automatic-insulation-stripper-wire-cutter-32-7awg/)                           | £22.99    | Did not need these, did most of the stripping with a stanely knife and also the cutter on these is terrible - gets jammed shut and you have to wiggle the cable. Better off using a pair of snips.  |
| **Solder**       | TBS Solder 100g, 0.8mm diameter          | [3DXR](https://www.3dxr.co.uk/building-c23/tools-c170/team-black-sheep-tbs-solder-100g-p5484)                           | £7.95    | Wanted some nicer solder than what came with the soldering station, this had good reviews, bundled it in with another order.  |
| **Velcro Tape**       | Hook & Loop Vectro Tape 50mm width (Industrial Strength)          | [3DXR](https://www.3dxr.co.uk/building-c23/tapes-c130/velcro-c350/3dxr-hook-loop-velcro-tape-industrial-strength-ps51-ps52-per-metre-p5425)                           | 2 x £4.00 = £8.00    | Sold by the metre.  |
| **Soldering Station**       | YIHUA 938BD+ Soldering Iron Station & Hot air rework station   | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08YD8JQHX?ref=cm_sw_r_cso_wa_apin_dp_24J10906KR0PERVB04V0&ref_=cm_sw_r_cso_wa_apin_dp_24J10906KR0PERVB04V0&social_share=cm_sw_r_cso_wa_apin_dp_24J10906KR0PERVB04V0)   | £89.99   | Recommended by [Tom's Hadware 2025](https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-soldering-irons), so far it has been great, heats up quickly, lots of different end effectors (or whatever they are actually called) has a sleep mode and the hot air functionality is also super handy.  |
| **Soldering Mat**       | yowtiny Soldering Mat Large - Silicon   | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09QGV8XP9?ref=cm_sw_r_cso_wa_apin_dp_CB30MFJB8ZQ0DSQ5YXZN&ref_=cm_sw_r_cso_wa_apin_dp_CB30MFJB8ZQ0DSQ5YXZN&social_share=cm_sw_r_cso_wa_apin_dp_CB30MFJB8ZQ0DSQ5YXZN&th=1)   | £11.99   | Great, saves me burning holes in things and ruining surfaces as I am doing all of this in a domestic setting, as opposed to a workshop. |
| **Heat Shrink Tubing**       | ASHINER Heat Shrink Tubing (580 pcs)   | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08XXGNJHG?ref=cm_sw_r_cso_wa_apin_dp_WCAW4BM14BTR3HMSM498&ref_=cm_sw_r_cso_wa_apin_dp_WCAW4BM14BTR3HMSM498&social_share=cm_sw_r_cso_wa_apin_dp_WCAW4BM14BTR3HMSM498&th=1)   | £8.99   | Required for protecting soldered joints of cable-cable and also cable-connector. |
|        |  |  | | | 
| **Tools Totals**       |            |   | **£221.69** |  |

Resulting in the total running cost of the project to be **£2631.64** (+ £162.84 mistakes).
