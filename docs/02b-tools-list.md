| **LiPo Safety Bag**       | GensAce LiPO Safe Bag          | [3DXR](https://www.3dxr.co.uk/electronics-c78/chargers-c74/gensace-gens-ace-lipo-safe-bag-p5557)                           | Â£9.99    | Cheaper ones were not in stock, this one is the same shape as the battery though which is nice.  |
| **LiPo Charger / DC Power Supply**       | SkyRC S100 neo AC 100W / DC 200W 1-6S Battery Charger          | [FlyingTech](https://www.flyingtech.co.uk/product/skyrc-s100-neo-battery-charger/)                           | Â£44.99    | So far this is great, wanted one that can be used as a DC supply so that I can use as a bench power for testing when building. Not sure how common this is with chargers but this one was well reviewed and not that expensive. It does not feel like a gigantic fire hazard! Also small enough that you could take it into the field when flying to assess battery status! A great allrounder. |
| **LiPo Charger to Croc Clips Lead**       | XT60 Female to Croc Clips Cable          | [FlyingTech](https://www.flyingtech.co.uk/product/charge-lead-adapter-xt60-female-to-crocodile-clips/)                           | Â£4.80    | So I could use the charger as a bench power supply.  |
| **Multimeter**       | Digital Multimeter          | [FlyingTech](https://www.flyingtech.co.uk/product/chy-a830l-digital-multimeter-w-backlit-display/)                           | Â£12.00    | Cheap and feels it, but serves its purpose for continutity checking.  |
| **Wire Strippers**       | Self Adjusting wire strippers and cutter          | [FlyingTech](https://www.flyingtech.co.uk/product/self-adjusting-automatic-insulation-stripper-wire-cutter-32-7awg/)                           | Â£22.99    | Did not need these, did most of the stripping with a stanely knife and also the cutter on these is terrible - gets jammed shut and you have to wiggle the cable. Better off using a pair of snips.  |
| **Solder**       | TBS Solder 100g, 0.8mm diameter          | [3DXR](https://www.3dxr.co.uk/building-c23/tools-c170/team-black-sheep-tbs-solder-100g-p5484)                           | Â£7.95    | Wanted some nicer solder than what came with the soldering station, this had good reviews, bundled it in with another order.  |
| **Velcro Tape**       | Hook & Loop Vectro Tape 50mm width (Industrial Strength)          | [3DXR](https://www.3dxr.co.uk/building-c23/tapes-c130/velcro-c350/3dxr-hook-loop-velcro-tape-industrial-strength-ps51-ps52-per-metre-p5425)                           | 2 x Â£4.00 = Â£8.00    | Sold by the metre.  |
