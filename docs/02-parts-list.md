# ðŸ§© Parts List

Below is a complete list of the components used to build the quadcopter, including the prices at the time of purchase and links to suppliers where available. I have also included some notes on why certain components were selected and any alternatives that were (more seriously) considered.


| Category        | Component                       | Supplier / Link                                                                 | Price (Â£) | Notes |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Frame**       | Tarot 650 Sport            | [FlyingTech](https://www.flyingtech.co.uk/product/tarot-650-sport-carbon-fibre-foldable-quadcopter-frame/)                           | Â£149.90    | 600mm wheelbase, carbon fibre, top plate is the Power Distribution Board (PDB), ideal size for carrying the payloads anticipated.  |
| **Motors**      | T-Motor MN 4014 330KV      | [3DXR](https://www.3dxr.co.uk/multirotor-c3/multirotor-motors-c35/t-motor-mn4014-p3510)                                        | Â£96.90    | Provide sufficient thrust for anticipated mass of quad, slightly overspecified but this will allow slightly larger battery and also more opportunity for alternative payload. Provide 830g of thrust with recommended props (selected below) at 50% throttle. Also operate on 6S battery voltage. |
| **ESCs**        | T-Motor Alpha 60A ESC - 6S                 | [3DXR](https://www.3dxr.co.uk/multirotor-c3/multirotor-escs-c48/t-motor-alpha-60a-6s-lv-p2888)                                           | Â£69.99    | Slight mistake made here, recommended alpha esc for the selected motor is the 40A version of this esc, also did not tell 3DXR as they were in seperate orders and had to buy the datalink v2 to flash the firmware myself. |
| **Flight Controller & GPS Bundle** | The Cube Orange+ Standard Set & Here 4 GPS        | [3DXR](https://www.3dxr.co.uk/autopilots-c2/the-cube-aka-pixhawk-2-1-c9/cube-autopilot-and-combos-c10/cubepilot-bundle-the-cube-orange-standard-set-hx4-06222-here-4-hx4-06248-p5610/s7072)                         | Â£600.00    | Lots of functionality, compatible with ardupilot, could easily be re-purposed for another use case. |
| **Propellers**  | T-Motor Carbon Prop P15x5         | [3DXR](https://www.3dxr.co.uk/multirotor-c3/multirotor-props-c265/t-motor-carbon-prop-p15x5-p2789)                                             | Â£55.90    | Price per pair. Reccommended props from T-Motor for selected motor pairing. |
| **Telemetry**    | RFDesign 868x - EU Radio Modem (UK & Europe Bundle)          | [3DXR](https://www.3dxr.co.uk/radio-gear-c33/telemetry-c31/868-mhz-telemetry-c65/rf-design-rfdesign-rfd-868x-eu-radio-modem-uk-and-europe-bundle-p4243/s4671)                             | Â£280.00    | UK compliant, long range >40km, well documented and usable software suite. |
| **Receiver**    | FrSky Archer PLUS RS 2.4GHz (OTA ACCESS)          | [3DXR](https://www.3dxr.co.uk/radio-gear-c33/receivers-c112/frsky-archer-plus-rs-2-4ghz-receiver-ota-access-p4556/s5005)                             | Â£21.50    | Very small, easy to incorporate into frame, ACCESS compatable and claimed range of â‰¥2km. |
| **Transmitter** | FrSky Tandem X18 Dual Band 900m/2.4GHz Radio              | [FlyingTech](https://www.flyingtech.co.uk/product/frsky-tandem-x18-x18s-x18se-dual-band-900m-2-4ghz-radio/)                                           | Â£267.90    | Well reviewed, compatable with ACCESS reciever, runs ETHOS which is also well reviewed. |
| **Battery**     | GensAce Tattu 7000 mAh 25C 6S1P 22.2V LiPo                | [3DXR](https://www.3dxr.co.uk/electronics-c78/batteries-c144/gensace-gens-ace-tattu-7000mah-25c-6s1p-22-2v-lipo-with-xt90-p3644)                                         | Â£132.90    | 6S compatable with motors, battery size compatable with frame, with the selected props, 3.6A @ 50% throttle so *4 = 14.4A (roughly at hover), giving approximate flight time of 30 minutes. |
| **Onboard Computer** | Raspberry Pi 5 16GB | [The Pi Hut](https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-5-starter-kit?variant=53972414693761)                                        | Â£147.00    | Will be used for running onboard algorithms. |

Then the things I 'had' to order after the fact because of some sort of mistake on my end...

| **For ESCs**       | T-Motor DataLink V2            | [3DXR](https://www.3dxr.co.uk/multirotor-c3/multirotor-escs-c48/t-motor-alpha-data-link-v2-p2899)                           | Â£154099    | I did not read the literal red text at the bottom of the ESC's description (or I did but then completleey forgot when ordering), so had to buy this bit of hardware such that I could program the ESCs to match the motors. More about this later...  |
| **Telemetry Cable**       | T-Motor DataLink V2            | [3DXR](https://www.3dxr.co.uk/multirotor-c3/multirotor-escs-c48/t-motor-alpha-data-link-v2-p2899)                           | Â£154099    | I did not read the literal red text at the bottom of the ESC's description (or I did but then completleey forgot when ordering), so had to buy this bit of hardware such that I could program the ESCs to match the motors.
