# 🧩 Parts List

Below is a complete list of the components used to build the quadcopter, including the prices at the time of purchase and links to suppliers where available. I have also included some notes on why certain components were selected and any alternatives that were (more seriously) considered. Everything in the table below I would consider as necessary (or at least some equivalent required) to make the drone functional. Between this and the [tools list](02b-tools-list.md), there were not many things I would say are entirely surplus to requirement.


| Category        | Component                       | Supplier / Link                                                                 | Price (£) | Mass (g) | Notes |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Frame**       | Tarot 650 Sport            | [FlyingTech](https://www.flyingtech.co.uk/product/tarot-650-sport-carbon-fibre-foldable-quadcopter-frame/)     | £149.90  | 750g  | 600mm wheelbase, carbon fibre, top plate is the Power Distribution Board (PDB), ideal size for carrying the payloads anticipated.  |
| **Motors**      | T-Motor MN 4014 330KV      | [3DXR](https://www.3dxr.co.uk/multirotor-c3/multirotor-motors-c35/t-motor-mn4014-p3510)      | 4 x £96.90  = £387.60 | 4 x 160g = 640g   | Provide sufficient thrust for anticipated mass of quad, slightly overspecified but this will allow slightly larger battery and also more opportunity for alternative payload. Provide 830g of thrust with recommended props (selected below) at 50% throttle. Also operate on 6S battery voltage. |
| **ESCs**        | T-Motor Alpha 60A ESC - 6S                 | [3DXR](https://www.3dxr.co.uk/multirotor-c3/multirotor-escs-c48/t-motor-alpha-60a-6s-lv-p2888)       | 4 x £69.99 = £279.96 | 4 x 63g = 252g  | Slight mistake made here, recommended alpha esc for the selected motor is the 40A version of this esc, also did not tell 3DXR as they were in seperate orders and had to buy the datalink v2 to flash the firmware myself. |
| **Flight Controller & GPS Bundle** | The Cube Orange+ Standard Set & Here 4 GPS        | [3DXR](https://www.3dxr.co.uk/autopilots-c2/the-cube-aka-pixhawk-2-1-c9/cube-autopilot-and-combos-c10/cubepilot-bundle-the-cube-orange-standard-set-hx4-06222-here-4-hx4-06248-p5610/s7072)       | £600.00 | 133g   | Lots of functionality, compatible with ardupilot, could easily be re-purposed for another use case. |
| **Propellers**  | T-Motor Carbon Prop P15x5         | [3DXR](https://www.3dxr.co.uk/multirotor-c3/multirotor-props-c265/t-motor-carbon-prop-p15x5-p2789)     | 2 x £55.90 = £111.80  | 4 x 21g = 84g |  Priced per pair, need four in total. Reccommended props from T-Motor for selected motor pairing. |
| **Telemetry**    | RFDesign 868x - EU Radio Modem (UK & Europe Bundle)          | [3DXR](https://www.3dxr.co.uk/radio-gear-c33/telemetry-c31/868-mhz-telemetry-c65/rf-design-rfdesign-rfd-868x-eu-radio-modem-uk-and-europe-bundle-p4243/s4671)        | £280.00  | 15g  | UK compliant, long range >40km, well documented and usable software suite. |

I initially ordered the wrong one of these and had to order another (see table below). The one i actuall;y wanted was XT60 Female to XT90 Male.|
| **Battery to PDB (pigtail)**       | XT60 10cm Pigtail connector    | [FlyingTech](https://www.flyingtech.co.uk/product/xt30-xt60-xt90-male-female-10cm-wired-pigtail-connectors/)    | £1.90 | -  | I ordered a female one, if I was going to do it again, I would order a male one and flip some of the connections round. |

| **Totals**       |            |   | **£2409.95** | **2,839.3g** |  |

I have bundled all of the 'cabling and connectors' into a conservative 50g estimate when doing the mass calcualtions. Meaning that I am currently working to a total mass of **~2.839kg** and a total cost (without tooling and mistakes) of **£2409.95**.

## Items Due to Mistakes
Then the things I 'had' to order after the fact because of some sort of mistake on my end...

| Category        | Component                       | Supplier / Link                                                                 | Price (£) | Mass (g) | Notes |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------|-------|
| **For ESCs**       | T-Motor DataLink V2            | [3DXR](https://www.3dxr.co.uk/multirotor-c3/multirotor-escs-c48/t-motor-alpha-data-link-v2-p2899)                           | £154.99  | NOT ON DRONE  | Probably (and hopefully!) the most expensive mistake I made. I did not read the literal red text at the bottom of the ESC's description (or I did but then completley forgot when ordering), so had to buy this bit of hardware such that I could program the ESCs to match the motors. More about this later...  |
| **Battery Connection Converter (wrong one)**       | XT60 to XT90 Plug adapter            | [FlyingTech](https://www.flyingtech.co.uk/product/xt60-to-xt90-plug-adapter/)                           | £3.90  | - | I initially ordered a XT60 Male to XT90 Female which was the wrong way round for my setup... |
| **Battery Connection Converter (due to bad planning)**       | XT60 Male to XT60 Male adapter            | [eBay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/256806148373?_skw=xt60+to+xt60+male&itmmeta=01K1V0VPN5JNV7MGNVFVRVN86S&hash=item3bcad6d915:g:tHQAAOSwkeBno5TD&itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA8FkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1f8RswwPG%2Bp4dUs3tfdNTHv5TCnhoiIjJoJsykYPAzzIZl3cGETnnkZQ2vRtByFgbY9mHn06FPqsdrHa%2F8cx0bWFw5xzzHmnyAxpgu0sOXXk%2Fwajzcuk7ZaJpAUE7ODxqa4GnCzoBD%2BdELVG%2BpsGsdkQQqWvpk5JcTXGCIji0RKcjHf0fJi%2F5u2bRujM%2BmxkERxIxVaSlw0AuXTE43ElvRurXY0CRkQkHvZ%2Fvrhm63Bt3I3O1wqRY5%2F9Zrqsj25sItxTP6GSQUlv3Aqxl3X52js0IY6OH81JKnYxIuXxwzsZQ%3D%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR-jq7uCOZg)    | £3.95  | -  | Due to my evident poor planning of connector availability and the fact that I jumped the gun and already soldered the pigtail to the PDB, I decided it would be easier to just get a converter to make it work rather than changing the pigtail for a male ended XT60. |
|        |  |  | | | |
| **Totals (incl. mistakes)**       |            |   | **£2572.79** | **2,839.3g** |  |

So now, including the fact that I did not request the ESC's to be programmed to my motors, the running total is **£2572.79**. Herein, I will delcare the running total as a price + mistakes.
